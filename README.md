# mendax-acct
This project should add accounting features to all-in-one commercial VPN solution called SoftEther backed by FreeRadius. SoftEther does not have a solution to send accounting packages to FreeRadius by itself, this project should fix that. It utilizes syslog-ng and PHP cronjobs to capture user data from log files and crafts it into accounting packages.

This solution is not plug and play, this repo is intended for me to fulfill my cloning needs when creating new VPN nodes.
